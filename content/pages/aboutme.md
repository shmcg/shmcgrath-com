Title: About Me

I am originally from Pittsburgh, PA and am currently an intern at Plus Consulting on the Dynamics CRM team.

I have a big interest on working on the back end of systems, particularly those written in COBOL. I took two semesters of COBOL and enjoy writing in the language.

Recently, I have begun to play around with Python. I am working on a couple simple scripts and used Pelican to create this website. In my free time I am going to be working on creating my own Pelican theme over the next couple of months.

In my free time I like to read, play video games, and watch sports. I have made sporadic efforts to learn German and want to re-focus on that when I graduate from RMU in May.
